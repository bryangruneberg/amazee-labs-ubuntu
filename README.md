# Amazee Labs - Ubuntu Tools

This repo contains a bunch of scripts that we are using to ease and facillitate running Ubuntu at Amazee Labs

## Installation
The project is driven by composer. We'll create a packagist project at some point soon, but for now:
 - Clone the repo
 - run composer install
 - run ./amazee-labs-ubuntu

## Contributing
PRs are welcome!!

On the Amazee Labs slack, there is a #ubuntu channel
